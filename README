NAME
	libcoopgamma - Cooperative gamma library

DESCRIPTION
	libcoopgamma is a C library that enables programs
	to communicate with coopgammad(1), and eventually
	mds-coopgamma(1). The advantage of using
	libcoopgamma over directly communicating with the
	display server is you get support for multiple
	display servers transparently (just like with
	libgamma(7)), more importantly, all programs that
	use libcoopgamma can change the gamma ramps without
	overriding each others changes, they add their
	own filters. Filters are ordered by their selected
	priority and chained together by the cooperative
	gamma server (coopgammad(1) or mds-coopgamma(1))
	and the result is applied. A third advantage is
	that you can choose when the filter shall be
	removed, this can either be not until it is
	explicitly requested, or until the client that add
	(or lasted modified) the filter disconnects from
	the server or when explicitly requested, whichever
	comes first.

RATIONALE
	One program cannot do everything and still be
	user friendly.
