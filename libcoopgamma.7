.SH "NAME"
libcoopgamma - Cooperative gamma library
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B libcoopgamma
is a C library that enables programs to communicate with
.BR coopgammad (1),
and eventually
.BR mds-coopgamma (1).
The advantage of using
.B libcoopgamma
over directly communicating with the display server is
you get support for multiple display servers transparently
(just like with
.BR libgamma (7)),
more importantly, all programs that use libcoopgamma can
change the gamma ramps without overriding each others
changes, they add their own filters. Filters are ordered
by their selected priority and chained together by the
cooperative gamma server
.RB ( coopgammad (1)
or
.BR mds-coopgamma (1))
and the result is applied. A third advantage is that you
can choose when the filter shall be removed, this can
either be not until it is explicitly requested, or until
the client that add (or lasted modified) the filter
disconnects from the server or when explicitly requested,
whichever comes first.
.P
.B libcoopgamma
prints warnings and errors, that cannot be returned,
to stderr. It is preferred that you have a non-static
.I "char *"
with the name
.I argv0
where the name of the process
.RI ( argv[0] )
is stored.
.SH "RATIONALE"
One program cannot do everything and still be user friendly.
